# Network Delay Time

Can you solve this real interview question? Network Delay Time - You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1


Example 3:


Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
